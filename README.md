Updated version of the previous simon game ( https://github.com/osho81/SimonGame ). 
In this version the player can choose grid-size, i.e. number of squares to memorize patterns for. 2x2, 3x3 or 4x4 squares.

The squares blinks, and the player must click the same square that blinked. Each round the pattern of blinking squares is incremented by one square. 
Each round the player can click the same squares that blinked, in the same order as the blinking pattern, the player has achieved a game level.
Otherwise it is game over.
